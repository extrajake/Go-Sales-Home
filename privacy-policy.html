                Protecting your privacy is important to Go Sales Holdings Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively
                referred to as the “Corporation”). Go Sales Licensing Inc., Go 2 Solar Inc. and Go 2 Security
                Ltd. are subsidiaries of the Corporation.
                This Website Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how the Corporation collects, uses and
                discloses the personal and non-personal information you may provide, or that we may collect,
                while using this website (the “Website”) and the services it provides (the “Services”).
                <br><br>
                1. Consent
                <br><br>
                By using the Website or the Services, or by submitting your personal information to the
                Corporation or to the Website, you signify your consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of
                your personal information in accordance with this Policy. If you do not consent to the collection,
                use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy, you may not use
                the Website or the Services, or submit your personal information to the Corporation or the
                Website. Note that certain services can only be offered to you if you provide personal
                information to the Corporation and therefore the Corporation may not be able to provide you
                those services if you choose not to provide the Corporation with personal information.
                <br><br>
                2. Information Automatically Collected
                <br><br>
                The Website automatically collects certain non-personal information regarding Website users
                (such as the date and time you access the Website, the Internet Protocol address of your
                computer or device you are using, the website from which you linked directly to the Website, the
                browser you are using, and the Website pages read and the content accessed or downloaded).
                This non-personal information is used for system administration purposes such as analyzing
                trends, administering our Website, tracking user movements, and gathering demographic
                information for internal use such as statistical assessments, website improvement and
                improving user experience. Non-personal information may be disclosed to other persons and
                permanently archived for future use. 
                <br><br>
                If non-personal information is combined with personal
                information, then the non-personal information will be treated as personal information.
                The Website uses “cookies”, a technology that installs information on a website user’s computer
                to permit the Website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the
                convenience of the Website. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to
                recognize you as a previous user of the Website, offer personalized content and information for
                your use, and otherwise facilitate your experience using the Website.
                <br><br>
                Most recent browser versions allow you to set some level of control over which cookies are
                accepted and how your browser uses them. For example, it may be set to notify you when it is
                receiving a cookie so that you accept cookies from only known, reliable sites such as this one. If
                you are concerned about cookies, we encourage you to upgrade your browser to a recent
                version and review the Help section of your browser to learn more about its specific control
                features.
                <br><br>

                
                3. Personal Information You Provide
                <br><br>
                Personal Information: In this Policy, “personal information” is information about an identifiable
                individual, such as your name, address, and email address. To the extent permitted by law, the
                provisions of this Policy concerning “personal information” do not apply to information that
                enables you to be contacted at a place of business (such as your business telephone number
                and business email address).
                <br><br>
                Use of Your Personal Information: During your use of the Website, you may be asked to
                voluntarily provide personal information for purposes such as corresponding with you, providing
                Services to you, or other purposes specified at the time of collection. Personal information we
                collect to use for these purposes includes your name, email, job title, social media handles
                and/or name of your workplace. the Corporation will not use your personal information for
                purposes other than those for which it is collected, except with your consent or as permitted or
                required by applicable law. Additionally, the Corporation may keep a record of all
                communications with you.
                <br><br>
                Disclosure of Your Information: The Corporation may disclose your personal information as
                required or permitted by applicable law to its agents, suppliers, contractors and service
                providers for use in connection with matters relating to your use of the Website, the
                Corporation’s provision of Services to you, or otherwise as specified by the Corporation at the
                time of collection. The Corporation may also disclose your personal information to other persons
                at your request, with your consent, or in connection with an investigation or proceeding to
                investigate or protect you and other persons and the Corporation from error, risk, fraud, or
                criminal activity.
                <br><br>
                The Corporation will not sell or rent your personal information to any third party.
                The Corporation has no control over, and no responsibility or liability for, those persons’ use and
                disclosure of your personal information, and that use and disclosure is not subject to this Policy.
                Use of Your Contacts’ Personal Information: During your use of the Website, you may be
                asked to voluntarily provide personal information of third parties for the purposes of referring the
                Services or sending a job posting or other specified purposes. If you provide personal
                information of another individual to the Corporation you represent that prior to providing the
                personal information, you have obtained consent or authority to permit the Corporation to
                collect, use and disclose such information for the purpose set out in this Policy, or as required or
                permitted by applicable law. 
                <br><br>
                If you provide a third party’s personal information, the Corporation
                will automatically send such third party a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Website
                or for the specified purpose. The third party’s information will be retained by the Corporation for
                the purpose of providing the one-time email.
                <br><br>
                Depersonalized Information: The Corporation may use your personal information to create
                non-personal information regarding the use of the Website and the Services. We may use and
                disclose this aggregate data to better understand our overall user base and for other purposes
                in our sole discretion. The Corporation may permanently retain non-personal information for
                future use.
                <br><br>
                Withdrawing Consent: You may withdraw your consent to the use and disclosure of your
                personal information, but doing so may mean that the Corporation cannot provide Services to
                you. To withdraw consent, please contact privacyoffice@gosales.co.
                <br><br>

                Retention of Your Information: The Corporation retains your personal information for as long
                as required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as may be required by law. When
                no longer required, your personal information will be destroyed, anonymized, or disposed of
                using secure methods.
                <br><br>
                Location of Information: The Corporation will store and process your personal information in
                secured locations. Please be aware that the disclosure of your information in accordance with
                this Policy and applicable law may result in your personal information being either stored at or
