            <h3>
                GO SALES Holdings Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively “GO SALES”) values its relationship with its Suppliers (defined below) and their contribution to our success. We partner with Suppliers who demonstrate a strong commitment to ethical, human rights and health and safety practices that align with ours and ensure the well-being of their teams. 
This Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”) is an extension of GO SALES’ Code of Conduct & Ethics. It reflects our values and the expectations we have of our suppliers, contractors, agents and consultants and their respective employees and contractors (collectively “Suppliers”). It also affirms GO SALES’ commitment to its Suppliers to maintain a high level of ethical and lawful conduct in everything we do. GO SALES reserves the right to periodically review and update this Supplier Code.
For clarity, the obligations set out in this Supplier Code are in addition to, and do not limit, Suppliers’ obligations under any agreements with GO SALES.
<br><br>
Ethics
<br><br>
To achieve long-term success in the marketplace, our Suppliers must uphold high ethical standards, including:
Business Integrity: Our Suppliers must maintain high standards of courtesy, professionalism, fairness and honesty when dealing with GO SALES’ clients, other suppliers, customers and competitors, and comply with all applicable federal, provincial, state and local laws. 
<br><br>
Bribery and Corruption: Our Suppliers must also comply with all applicable laws in the jurisdiction in which they operate, and refrain from engaging in any form of bribery, corruption, including kickbacks, extortion, or the promising, offering, approving, giving or accepting of payments or gifts that are, or could be viewed as, an attempt to influence an individual’s actions, business decision or creating a sense of obligation. GO SALES does not permit facilitation payments to be made. 
<br><br>
Improper Advantage: Our Suppliers must familiarize themselves with the GO SALES’ Code of Ethics & Conduct that provides guidance to GO SALES team members on offering or accepting gifts, gratuities, rewards, favours or benefits. Our Suppliers must refrain from placing GO SALES’ team members in a position where they are, or may be perceived to be, in breach of the GO SALES Code of Ethics & Conduct. 
<br><br>
Privacy: Our Suppliers must respect the privacy of our clients, customers and team members, and be demonstrably accountable for personal information entrusted to them by GO SALES, including personal information the Supplier collects or creates for GO SALES. Suppliers must collect, use and disclose personal information only as directed by GO SALES or required by law. Our Suppliers must assist GO SALES in meeting privacy obligations set out in applicable laws, contracts and GO SALES’ own high privacy standards. This includes facilitating access requests and fulfilling other individual rights, informing GO SALES of actual or suspected data breaches, supporting GO SALES responses to inquiries, complaints and investigations, and implementing effective retention processes. 
<br><br>
Information Security: Suppliers must appropriately safeguard all GO SALES and its clients’ information entrusted to them, and be committed to the highest level of cybersecurity in their own operations and activities and in those of any subcontractors or other suppliers. Unless disclosure is authorized or legally mandated (for example, by court order), our Suppliers must protect confidential and restricted information, in compliance with all applicable laws and contractual obligations. To this end, Suppliers must perform their work in a way that protects GO SALES’ and its clients’ information and operations. Suppliers must not bypass, circumvent, or otherwise compromise GO SALES’ or its clients’ security policies and controls. 
<br><br>
Should a Supplier become aware of a cyber incident or potential breach that could impact GO SALES, its clients or the security of GO SALES’ or its clients’ operations or data, such Supplier must immediately report it to their GO SALES business prime and, if requested, provide a detailed written report, including any potential impacts on GO SALES’ data or systems. 
<br><br>
Intellectual Property: Our Suppliers must respect the proprietary rights and assets of GO SALES and its clients, and comply with their contractual and other obligations pertaining to intellectual property rights.
<br><br>
Fair Business, Anti-Spam, Advertising and Competition: Our Suppliers must adhere to fair business practices and comply with all applicable laws in the jurisdiction in which they operate relating to marketing/anti-spam, competition standards and advertising.
<br><br>
Non-Retaliation: Our Suppliers must refrain from retaliating against anyone who files a report or complaint, in good faith, relating to the Supplier, including with respect to a violation of this Supplier Code with the Supplier internally (such as a whistleblower), with GO SALES, or with any government agency. Our Suppliers must maintain whistleblower confidentiality. 
<br><br>
Conflicts of Interest: Our Suppliers are naturally involved in business relationships with people and organizations in addition to GO SALES. These relationships must not, and must not reasonably appear to, compromise Suppliers’ relationship with GO SALES, its clients or Suppliers’ ability to make impartial and objective business decisions in connection with the supply of goods and/or services to GO SALES. 
<br><br>
GO SALES Property: Our Suppliers must take reasonable technological, administrative and physical measures to safeguard GO SALES’ and its clients’ property, including GO SALES’ and its clients’ proprietary, confidential and restricted information, facilities, equipment, vehicles, funds, communication networks and information systems and material in their possession or under their control. This also applies to access controls, such as passwords, identification keys, cards and hand-held user authentication devices. 
<br><br>
Community Investment: Our Suppliers are encouraged to meaningfully engage and invest in the communities in which they live, work and serve to foster social and economic development.
<br><br>
Human Rights
<br><br>
Our Suppliers must uphold the human rights of workers, and treat them with dignity and respect in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
<br><br>
Respect Workplace:  Our Suppliers must provide a respectful workplace, free from harassment.
<br><br>
Non-discrimination: Our Suppliers must maintain a work environment, and recruitment practices (screening, hiring and retaining) free of discrimination and must not engage in discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, political convictions, marital status, family status, language, disability, or any other grounds prohibited by law.
<br><br>
Wages and Benefits: Compensation paid to workers must comply with all applicable wage laws, including those relating to minimum wages, overtime hours and legally mandated benefits. 
<br><br>
Health and Safety
<br><br>
At GO SALES, our goal is that everyone returns home safely.
<br><br>
Occupational Health and Safety: Our Suppliers must ensure that they operate their businesses in compliance with all applicable health and safety laws and regulations.
<br><br>
Fit for Work: Our Suppliers must require their workers to report fit for work, such that their ability to work safely is not impaired for any reason. Their workers should be free of the negative effects of alcohol, drugs, medications or any other substance that could cause impairment.
<br><br>

Implementation 
<br><br>
Suppliers must ensure their employees and contractors working on GO SALES’ business understand and comply with the contents of this Supplier Code.
GO SALES reserves the right to terminate any agreement with any Supplier in the event of non-compliance with this Supplier Code of Conduct.
